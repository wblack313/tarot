# The Four Elements

| Element  | Symbol | Meaning   |
|:--------:|:------:|-----------|
| Fire     | ðŸœ‚      | <p>Fire is hot, wild, unpredictable, and energetic. It can be creative in helping us to cook food or build tools, or it can be destructive, like a devastating bushfire or house fire. </p><p>The element of fire is symbolic of passion, energy, enthusiasm, and sexuality. It is a masculine element and reflects the drive and willpower of the masculine energy.</p><p> In the Tarot, the fire element is represented by the Suit of Wands. The Suit of Wands Tarot card meanings are associated with primal energy, spirituality, inspiration, determination, strength, intuition, creativity, ambition and expansion, original thought and the seeds through which life springs forth. <p/><p>Wands cards deal with the spiritual level of consciousness and mirror what is important to you at the core of your being. They address what makes us tick â€“ our personalities, egos, enthusiasms, self-concepts, and personal energy, both internal and external.<p/><p>The negative aspects of the Suit of Wands include illusion, egotistical behaviour, impulsiveness, a lack of direction or purpose, or feeling meaningless. There are four classical elements â€“ water, fire, earth and air â€“ each with its own symbolic meaning.</p>|
|Water| ðŸœ„ | <p>Water is fluid, agile and â€˜in flow' but it's also very powerful and formative. It can be soft and gentle, like waves lapping against the sandy shore, or it can be powerful and even forceful, like a raging river.<p/><p>The element of water is symbolic of fluidity, feelings and emotions, intuition, relationships, healing, and cleansing. It is a feminine element and reflects the subtle power that often resides within women. It is receptive, adaptable, purifying and flowing.<p/><p>In the Tarot, water relates to the Suit of Cups. The Suit of Cups Tarot card meanings deal with the emotional level of consciousness and are associated with love, feelings, relationships and connections. The Cups Tarot cards indicate that you are thinking with your heart rather than your head, and thus reflect your spontaneous responses and your habitual reactions to situations. Cups are also linked to creativity, romanticism, fantasy and imagination.<p/><p>The negative aspects of the Suit of Cups include being overly emotional or completely disengaged and dispassionate, having unrealistic expectations and fantasising about what could be. There may be repressed emotions, an inability to truly express oneself and a lack of creativity.<p/>
